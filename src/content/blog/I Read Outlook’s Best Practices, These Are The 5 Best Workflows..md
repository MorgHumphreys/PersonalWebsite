Do your emails plague your inbox, exponentially multiplying with no way to humanly process them?

When you open your mailbox, it doesn’t have to be a pandemic of subject lines out there. It could be a clean slate. Outlook is a powerful tool that workers constantly underutilise; it’s time to change that.

Optimising your email has never been easier, it takes as little as 30 minutes.

<h5>1. Utilise the archive button.</h5>
The archive button is the most powerful function of outlook and will allow you to keep your inbox empty.

The button will instantly transport a redundant email to the archive folder. Every email that does not need to refer to or is not relevant to you should meet this fate. A quick skim, and you can metaphorically check it off within 10 seconds (depending on the email length). An empty inbox is a good inbox.

<h5>2. Show chains as conversations.</h5>
Are you sick of trying to piece together an email chain from the default outlook view?

Hidden under the view subheading, you can find a check box to merge chains marked ‘Show as Conversation’. This button will keep chains linked together in one subject line — no more time-wasting searching for each different branch reply.

<h5>3. Set up rules for spammy emails.</h5>
We all get spammy emails, and whether it’s from that Trello board you signed up to once or another ticket update, it’s time to file them automatically.

There is no need to categorise the same subject report every week. Set a rule to organise it automatically. Spam emails have no reason to be sorted by you; it clogs your inbox and increases the chance of missed essential emails. Automate what you can.

<h5>4. Use quick steps for frequent mass emails.</h5>
Sending bulk emails can be time-consuming, especially when remembering the same 15 people to send it to every week.

Never waste 2 minutes again by setting up a quickstep button to do the action for you. You can also set quick steps to organise emails to specific folders similar to the archive button. Regular time-consuming tasks can be shorted here!

<h5>5. Use conditional formating to locate direct emails.</h5>
Direct emails from colleagues are your most important ones to look at; no one else can get back to them.

Use conditional formatting to adjust the subject line’s colour and text size, so you never miss one. Once these emails stand out, they should be the first ones to be dealt with. Use your energy where it counts.

Outlook is far from a simple mail client, it is optimised to help you process large amounts of data quickly, don’t underesitmate it.
