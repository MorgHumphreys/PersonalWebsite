	<h3>ðŸ‘‹ Hi Traveller, I'm Morgan   </h3>
	<p>
		I'm a solution weaver for business problems who uses technology to empower people. I've spent the first two years of my IT career digitally transforming
		S&S Industries, from a paper process kingdom through to a digital revolution. I'm a process-driven designer with a human-first approach. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm a caffiene addict, generally you will see me drinking black filter coffee as my daily driver. I could talk about 
		coffee for days, so unless you want me to talk your ear off Caffiene related questions should be asked with caution.
